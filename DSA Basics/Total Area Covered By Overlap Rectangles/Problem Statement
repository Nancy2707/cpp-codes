You are given two arbitrary rectangles on a 2-D coordinate plane, which may have an intersecting area. You have to find the net area covered by both the rectangles on the cartesian plane.


The orange area depicted in the above figure is the net area covered by both rectangles on the cartesian plane.

Note:

1. For a rectangle, its top left and bottom right coordinates are given.

2. Coordinates of the rectangles are integer values.

3. Edges of the given rectangles will always be parallel to the X and Y coordinate axes of the cartesian plane.

4. It is guaranteed that both the rectangles will have at least a unit area.
