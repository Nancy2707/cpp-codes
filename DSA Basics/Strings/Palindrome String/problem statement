You are given a string 'S'. Your task is to check whether the string is palindrome or not. For checking palindrome, consider alphabets and numbers only and ignore the symbols and whitespaces.

Note :

String 'S' is NOT case sensitive.
Example :

Let S = “c1 O$d@eeD o1c”.
If we ignore the special characters, whitespaces and convert all uppercase letters to lowercase, we get S = “c1odeedo1c”, which is a palindrome. Hence, the given string is also a palindrome.
